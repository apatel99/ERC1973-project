# ERC1973-project

Description:-

I propose a digital distributed solution for seed funding organization. In my contract I’ll be implementing the factory pattern to yield contracts for every sector mentioned above. Since I am using the factory pattern, every instance of the contract would be dedicated for one specific project. So there are many possibilities in future but we'd stick to the basic implementation so as to understand the working of ERC 1973 for this use case.

Working:-

The contract would continue to accept funds from participants and keep building strategies to distribute rewards that would come up in future with the help of ERC 1973 and ERC20.

After a certain block interval of say 1000 blocks, it’d distribute the return on investments with all the participants following the ERC1973 implementation of scalable rewards distribution.

The investors can then exchange the ERC1973 tokens for stable coins with the firm as and when they wish to. 

By using ERC 1973 we are able to scale our project, as gas is the bottleneck for Ethereum and blockchain transactions, in general. 

For such a use case such an implementation proves to be useful.

Also, in future we can delegate the decision making responsibility to the investors too.
